Mathparse Documentation
=======================

.. note::
   As of April 2025, the ``mathparse`` documentation has moved under the
   ChatterBot domain in an effort to group these projects closer together.
   While both projects are distinctly different, and serve vastly different
   purposes, they both benefit from being a part of an ecosystem of software
   libraries that are commonly used together.
